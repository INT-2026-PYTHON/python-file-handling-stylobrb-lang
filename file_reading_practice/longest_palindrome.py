=================================================
LONGEST PALINDROME
=================================================

Problem Statement:
Read the text file `sowpods.txt` and find the
LONGEST PALINDROME word in the file.

If multiple palindromes share the maximum
length, print ALL of them.

-------------------------------------------------
Input Example (sowpods.txt sample):
level
radar
noon
civic
deified
racecar
rotator
malayalam

Output Example:
Longest palindrome length: 9
malayalam

-------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
Lengths of the palindromes in the sample:
   level    -> 5
   radar    -> 5
   noon     -> 4
   civic    -> 5
   deified  -> 7
   racecar  -> 7
